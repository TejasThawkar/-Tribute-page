                            Dravid is known for his technique, and has been one of the most successful batsmen of the Indian cricket team.[209] Early in his career, he was known as a defensive batsman who was best at playing Test cricket, and was dropped from the ODI squad due to
                            a low strike rate. However, he later scored improved his ability to score well in ODIs, earning him the ICC Player of the Year award.[210] His nickname of 'The Wall' in Reebok advertisements is now used as his nickname.[citation
                            needed] Dravid has scored 36 centuries in Test cricket, with an average of 52.31; this includes five double centuries. In one-dayers, he averaged 39.16, with a strike rate of 71.23.[211] He is one of the few Indians whose Test
                            average is better while playing away than at home, averaging almost five runs more on foreign pitches.[212] As of 23 September 2010, Dravid's Test average abroad is 55.53, while his Test average at home is 50.76;[212] his ODI
                            average abroad is 37.93[213] and his ODI average at home is 43.11. [214] Dravid averages 66.34 runs in Indian Test victories.[215] and 50.69 runs in ODIs.[216]Dravid's sole Test wicket was of Ridley Jacobs in the fourth Test
                            match against the West Indies during the 2001–2002 series.[218] Dravid often kept wickets for India in ODIs.[219] Dravid was involved in two of the largest partnerships in ODIs: a 318-run partnership with Sourav Ganguly, the
                            first pair to combine for a 300-run partnership,[220] and a 331-run partnership with Sachin Tendulkar, which is a world record.[221] He also holds the record for the greatest number of innings played since debut before being
                            dismissed for a duck. His highest scores in ODIs and Tests are 153 and 270, respectively.[222]He was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 2000.[223] Though primarily a defensive batsman, Dravid scored 50 runs not
                            out in 22 balls (a strike rate of 227.27) against New Zealand in Hyderabad on 15 November 2003, the second fastest 50 among Indian batsmen.[224] In 2004, Dravid was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India.[225] On
                            7 September 2004, he was awarded the inaugural Player of the year award and the Test player of the year award by the International Cricket Council (ICC).[226]After reaching the 10,000 Test runs milestone, he said, "It's a proud
                            moment for sure. For me, growing up, I dreamt of playing for India. When I look back, I probably exceeded my expectations with what I have done over the last 10 to 12 years. I never had an ambition to do it because I never
                            believed – it is just a reflection of my longevity in the game."[228] Dravid is also one of only two batsmen to score 10,000 runs at a single batting position and is the fourth highest run scorer in Test cricket, behind Tendulkar,
                            Ponting and Kallis.[229]
